### Escape

* Team members: Ali Ahmed, William Chung, Yifang He, Lam Tran

* Scrum master： Ali Ahmed/Lam Tran

* Product owner：William Chung

Live App: https://master.d39glwzrwynmmi.amplifyapp.com/ 

The App is meant to be viewed on strictly mobile and has not been optimized for desktop/laptop use. If you want to see it on desktop, press F12 and on the top left of the new panel, click the icon that looks like a phone/tablet.

### Info:

- Mobile Web App that allows users to play an "Escape room" on their phone outside of the house.

- The game rooms are location based (You must be at the location to play the game.) 

- This project is targeted at City College students until we can allow users to create their own game based on location.




## How to install and demo on your computer

1. `cd` to the directory with the project files.
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
